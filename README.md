_Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?_
Because he believes that many students are not getting enough instruction for driving and are therefore failing their examinations, the creator of DriverPass is passionate about creating an extensive online driver training platform. A user-friendly system that allows student drivers to sign up for a personalized driving school that includes interactive tests, online training modules, and in-car coaching is the aim. Users will be able to customize their training plans and make their own accounts. Admins offer assistance when required because they will have administrative access to all employee and student accounts.

_What did you do particularly well?_
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I believe I didn't do extremely well in particular areas of this course, but I think I did well in learning the process flow of UMLs throughout this class.

_If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?_
What could have been improved is the Class diagram. In order to demonstrate the relationships, I would add more detail, and maybe add additional entities or attributes to represent subtleties in the business logic. That would have resulted in a more thorough and precise visual depiction of the system. I don't think I've quite nailed this request yet.

_How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?_
It was easier to work with when the requirements were separated for each party.  The needs of the client are crucial because the project won't be beneficial to them if the specifications aren't met.  In essence, we could not have finished the project without the specifications.

_How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?_
I would want to obtain the specifications for the new system functionalities before beginning to create the program.  Once the system was designed, I would incorporate the additional functionality. In order to examine in the future, I would need some input (I made very difficult). I may then proceed to make any necessary adjustments or modifications to make the system function better.
